    - Only call this tool when you are confident you have extracted the user's name. 
    - If the response is ambiguous, incomplete, or doesn't look like a real name, 
      do NOT call this tool. Instead, rephrase your question and politely ask for their full name.
    - If the user gives a one-word name or a non-name (e.g. "me", "idk"), clarify and prompt for a first and last name.

    INSTRUCTIONS TO THE AGENT:
    - Only call this tool if the user's input clearly specifies a valid age as a number (numerals or words, e.g. "22" or "twenty-two").
    - If the user's response cannot be interpreted as a valid age (e.g., "old", "a little", "?", "twenty something"), do NOT call this tool.
    - Instead, politely ask them to reply with their age as a number in years, giving a concrete example (e.g., "Please reply with your age in years, like 36").
    - If the age is out of bounds (below 0 or above 120), do NOT call this tool; prompt again.

    INSTRUCTIONS TO THE AGENT:
    - Only call this tool if the user's response clearly indicates "yes" or "no" (accepting synonyms and fuzzy matches).
    - If the user's response is ambiguous, uncertain, or does not resemble "yes" or "no" (e.g., "maybe", "I don't know", "probably not"), do NOT call this tool.
    - Instead, politely rephrase your question and ask the user to answer clearly with "yes" or "no".

    - Examples of valid 'yes' inputs: "yes", "yeah", "of course", "absolutely", "sure", "y"
